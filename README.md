# ProjectEuler
Looking to get practice with Python and C++ to solve these problems

Each Project Euler question will have its own folder.

Within each folder, there will contain a PDF (produced using LaTeX) with my mathematical solution and two code files, *.cpp & *.py

I will attempt to solve the problem using Python and C++ languages! (keyword: attempt)
